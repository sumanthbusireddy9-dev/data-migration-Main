In the era of the Internet of Things (IoT), the rise of sensor networks has become important in real-time data collection. This paper addresses the challenges posed by traditional relational databases in handling extensive time-series and spatial data generated by IoT sensors. Focusing on the migration from MySQL to specialized databases like InfluxDB and PostGIS, this paper introduces a comprehensive framework.

By using multithreading, the migration process is optimized for efficiency. Simulation of IoT data is done by generating the relevant data. Migration without multithreading and with multithreading has been done and the time taken by these processes has been compared. The results show that the data migration with multithreading is faster than the migration without multithreading. By seamlessly transitioning weather sensor-generated time series and spatial data, this paper can be used as a blueprint for data migration of time-series and spatial data, addressing the demands of the IoT era. The study underscores the significance of efficient data migration in preserving historical data while ensuring seamless migration with new databases. Data validation has also been done to ensure data integrity.
